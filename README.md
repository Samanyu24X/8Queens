# 8Queens
Project for CS4200 -  Artificial Intelligence  

This project tests two algorithms: the Steepest Ascent Hill-Climbing algorithm, and the Genetic algorithm

We were required to prove that the Steepest Ascent Hill-Climbing algorithm has a success percentage of about 14%, so my program tests a large amount of randomized test cases using the SAHC algorithm and prints a success rate. My success rate was consistently around 14%.  

For the genetic algorithm, we were required to use crossover breeding and mutation. The "fittest" iterations of the 8 Queens were selected and cross-bred with each other, along with a chance of random mutations to increase genetic variety. I found that the more I increased the size of the population and breeding iterations, there was a better chance of finding a solution.
